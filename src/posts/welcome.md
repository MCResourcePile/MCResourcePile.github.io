Welcome to ResourcePile, a community driven project with contributors from Overcast Network and Avicus Network groups. This project offers a range of resources and tools related to these networks which can be broken down into three main groups:

*   **[Maps](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps) -** A collection of publicly downloadable maps from Overcast Network and Avicus Network that players can use on their own servers or privately explore in single player
*   **[Tournament Records](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/tournaments) -** Keeping track of information and results from past tournaments from various competitive server networks
*   **[Statistics](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/stats) -** Tracking various statistics such as longest kill distances by bow, and other website statistics like objective leaderboards
