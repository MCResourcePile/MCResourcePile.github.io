			<p><i>Hi there, I'm Crazy. Back in October, I took over this project from Matic0B. Back then, there was just the longest bow records. Over the last several months, we've grown so much. We've expanded what this project focuses on, with the addition of MapStack, ToolRack, and more stats for StatTrack. We've even branched out to a different network seperate from the Overcast Network.<br><br>Being a part of this team, and working on expanding what started out as a little project, has been a wonderful experience. It's also helped me understand coding a little bit better, whether it's by interacting with code, or making mistakes as I try and add things.<br><br>If you've happened to stumble on this profile of mine, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for using our services, and thank you for sharing ResourcePile.</i></p>
