##Contributions to StatTrack

All records for StatTrack bow records are stored within a json file called `bow.json`. The `bow.html` file does **not** need to be edited.

* Overcast Network bow records: [`src/data/stattrack/overcast/bow.json`](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/MCResourcePile.github.io/blob/source/src/data/stattrack/overcast/bow.json)
* Avicus Network bow records: [`src/data/stattrack/avicus/bow.json`](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/MCResourcePile.github.io/blob/source/src/data/stattrack/avicus/bow.json)

Below is an example of how the records for the map `Abandoned Zoo` will look inside of this file.
```json
{
    "map": "Abandoned Zoo",
    "slug": "abandoned_zoo",
    "tags": [ {"tdm": true} ],
    "record_first": [ { "player_name": "KratosMC_", "player_uuid": "82b77cbf-8b1b-4902-8eb6-34b65dcefa43", "distance": "81", "evidence": ""} ],
    "record_second": [ { "player_name": "Hypetastic", "player_uuid": "27e6dd0d-595a-4881-882d-cc35151d7d21", "distance": "79", "evidence": ""} ],
    "record_third": [ { "player_name": "snatimal", "player_uuid": "b843e63b-4d8c-4606-b6da-08b3ed8534d1", "distance": "63", "evidence": ""} ],
},
```

##Contributions to MapStack

All maps listed on MapStack are stored within a json file called `network.json`. The `overcast.html` or `avicus.html` file in the mapstack folder does **not** need to be edited.

* Overcast Network map listing: [`src/data/mapstack/overcast.json`](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/MCResourcePile.github.io/blob/source/src/data/mapstack/overcast.json)
* Avicus Network map listing: [`src/data/mapstack/avicus.json`](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/MCResourcePile.github.io/blob/source/src/data/mapstack/avicus.json)

Below is an example of how the map `Abandoned Zoo` will look inside of this file.
